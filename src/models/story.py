''' 
Master Story class that contains data and methods for the entire story 
Our story is an extended ft.View, meaning new routes can display the story object directly
The Story object creates widgets (characters, chapters, notes, etc.) objects that are stored inside of itself.
Stories contain metadata, ui elements, and all the widgets, as well as methods to create new widgets only

''' 
Our widget class that displays our world building and lore information.
Our stories have one world building widget, that displays whichever map is selected
This widget stores 'WorldMaps', which stores sub 'Maps' for its continents, oceans, countries, dungeons etc.
Maps (sub maps) can store other sub maps infinitely, so a continent can store countries, which can store cities, etc, but don't need to be
Nested in any particular way. WorldMaps CANNOT store each other or be nested.

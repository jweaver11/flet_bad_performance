'''
The map class for all maps inside of the world_building widget
Maps are extended mini widgets, with their 'display' being the view of the map, and their mini widget being the maps info display
Maps don't save like mini widgets. They save their data inside one file, and their drawing data in another file.
Since maps could have hundreds of sub-maps, we give them each their own file to avoid corruption
'''

# BLANK NO TEMPLATE MAPS EXIST AS WELL
# ADD DUPLICATE OPTION AS WELL
# Users can choose to create their image or use some default ones, or upload their own
# When hovering over a map, display it on the rail as well so we can see where new sub maps would
